# Regression-and-time-series-analysis-using-house-sales-price

•In this project I have Developed 8 Linear regression models with different combination of factors to find best fit among 8 models. We used train/test split method and 10-fold cross validation to validate the data.
•Developed AR and ARMA time series model.
•Performed exploratory analysis on the datasets to find the heat map, different trends/patterns in dataset.
•Skills: Python Programming,Jupyter notebook,python libraries like sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
